# Features

1) Apply and remove colour filters on the go.
   > You no longer need to deep dig into operating system settings just to add or remove colour filters.
   > Only the image you wish to see on the specific tab, not the entire operating system, will be inverted.
   > You can toggle on or off the colour filter anytime, making distinguishing betweeen reality and filter even easier.

2) Add an optional colour overlay powered by Gemini.
   > With on-device Gemini, you can now enable an optional colour overlay suggested by AI.
   > Gemini will select the appropriate colour and opacity level based on your colour deficiency type.
   > Privacy is guaranteed. On-device AI meant data would not be sent to Google's servers.


# Limitations
